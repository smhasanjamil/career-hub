# Work Seeker

In this project, I have developed a job searching website with the following features:


## Features

- An efficient navbar with router implementation that allows seamless navigation between pages without triggering page reloads.
- The website displays job categories that are dynamically generated from a JSON file.
- It also shows a list of jobs, retrieved from another JSON file.
- Initially, only 4 jobs are displayed, but clicking the "See All Jobs" button reveals the complete list.
- Users can view detailed job descriptions by clicking on the "View Details" button.
- From the job details page, users can apply for the job.
- Once a job is applied for, the data is stored in the local storage.
- Users can view their applied jobs in the "Applied Jobs" page, which retrieves data from local storage.
- The website also has a statistics page that displays charts of assignment marks.
- Additionally, a blog page is included with relevant content.
- A well-designed footer for a professional and polished appearance.
